# gradle-learning

This repository consists of a couple of small Gradle tutorials from their site that I completed to introduce myself to Gradle.

They aren't meant to be run or really viewed by others, I use them as reference when I need to remember something about Gradle quickly

The projects are:
  - basic: Learning how to do the basics in Gradle
  - app: Learning how to create a Java app
  - lib: Learning how to create a Java library
